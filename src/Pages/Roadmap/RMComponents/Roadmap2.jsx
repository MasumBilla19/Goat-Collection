                    1. Production of the Goatoken ($GOTK) will begin. The pool in our Barn will turn into a liquidity pool. The Goats will now become possible to be swapped, for $GOTK as well.<br /><br />
                    2. Goat Nannies will come looking for their mates, and the mating period in the Barn will slowly start. Nannies' collection will also be based on our beloved female part of the industry. The G.O.A.T.s arsenal of our project will only become stronger!<br /><br />
                    3. Mating will become possible. If you hold both a Goat and a Nanny, you are in trouble because you will have to deal with the loud Me-e-eh! for the whole night.
